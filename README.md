This repository contains an unofficial PyTorch implementation of [BitNet a4.8: 4-bit Activations for 1-bit LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04965) (Wang et al., 2024).

## 📑 Paper Summary

BitNet a4.8 is a groundbreaking approach that enables 4-bit activations for 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs). The method employs a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy to mitigate quantization errors from outlier channels while maintaining model performance.

Key features:
- 4-bit quantization for attention and FFN inputs
- 8-bit quantization with sparsification for intermediate states
- Only 55% of parameters activated during inference
- Support for 3-bit KV cache
- Comparable performance to BitNet b1.58 with better inference efficiency

## 🚀 Implementation

This implementation includes:

```python
# Create a BitNet a4.8 model
model = create_model(
    hidden_size=4096,
    intermediate_size=11008,
    num_hidden_layers=32,
    num_attention_heads=32
)
```

Key components:
- RMSNorm for layer normalization
- 4-bit and 8-bit quantizers
- TopK sparsification
- BitLinear (1.58-bit weights)
- Hybrid attention mechanism
- Gated FFN with ReLU²

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitnet-a48
cd bitnet-a48
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Results

The implementation achieves performance comparable to BitNet b1.58 while enabling:
- 4-bit activation compression
- 45% parameter sparsity
- Reduced inference costs
- 3-bit KV cache support

## 🛠️ Usage

```python
from bitnet_a48 import create_model

# Initialize model
model = create_model(
    hidden_size=4096,
    intermediate_size=11008,
    num_hidden_layers=32,
    num_attention_heads=32
)

# Forward pass
outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask)
```

## 📈 Training

The model uses a two-stage training recipe:
1. Train with 8-bit activations and ReLU²GLU
2. Fine-tune with hybrid quantization and sparsification
